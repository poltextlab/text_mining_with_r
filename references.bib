Our work is based on recent results in word embeddings that learn semantically meaningful representations for words from local cooccurrences in sentences. The WMD distance measures the dissimilarity between two text documents as the minimum amount of distance that the embedded words of one document need to “travel” to reach the embedded words of another document. We show that this distance metric can be cast as an instance of the Earth Mover’s Distance, a well studied transportation problem for which several highly efﬁcient solvers have been developed. Our metric has no hyperparameters and is straight-forward to implement. Further, we demonstrate on eight real world document classiﬁcation data sets, in comparison with seven stateof-the-art baselines, that the WMD metric leads to unprecedented low k-nearest neighbor document classiﬁcation error rates.},

We empirically ground these dimensions in a set of annotation studies, and categorize applications according to these dimensions. Furthermore, we analyze the characteristics of the existing evaluation datasets, and use those datasets to assess the performance of common text similarity measures.},

With the aim of providing reference for related research and application, the text similarity measurement method is described by two aspects: text distance and text representation. The text distance can be divided into length distance, distribution distance, and semantic distance; text representation is divided into string-based, corpus-based, single-semantic text, multi-semantic text, and graph-structure-based representation. Finally, the development of text similarity is also summarized in the discussion section.},

Along with these changes in society, powerful new data science methods support research using administrative, internet, textual, and sensor-audio-video data. Burgeoning data and innovative methods facilitate answering previously hard-to-tackle questions about society by offering new ways to form concepts from data, to do descriptive inference, to make causal inferences, and to generate predictions. They also pose challenges as social scientists must grasp the meaning of concepts and predictions generated by convoluted algorithms, weigh the relative value of prediction versus causal inference, and cope with ethical challenges as their methods, such as algorithms for mobilizing voters or determining bail, are adopted by policy makers.},

We combine a quantitative text analysis approach with supervised learning and limited human resources in order to classify the front-page articles of a leading Hungarian daily newspaper based on their full text. Our goal was to assign items in our dataset to one of policy topics based on the codebook of the Comparative Agendas Project. The classification of the imbalanced classes of topics was handled by a hybrid binary snowball workflow. This relies on limited human resources as well as supervised learning; it simplifies the multiclass problem to one of binary choice; and it is based on a snowball approach as we augment the training set with machine-classified observations a er each successful round and also between corpora. Our results show that our approach provided better precision results (of over \% for most topic codes) than what is customary for human coders and most computer-assisted coding projects. Nevertheless, this high precision came at the expense of a relatively low, below \%, share of labeled articles.},

@article{niwattanakulUsingJaccardCoefficient2013,
	title = {Using of {Jaccard} {Coefficient} for {Keywords} {Similarity}},
	abstract = {Presently, information retrieval can be accomplished simply and rapidly with the use of search engines. This allows users to specify the search criteria as well as specific keywords to obtain the required results. Additionally, an index of search engines has to be updated on most recent information as it is constantly changed over time. Particularly, information retrieval results as documents are typically too extensive, which affect on accessibility of the required results for searchers. Consequently, a similarity measurement between keywords and index terms is essentially performed to facilitate searchers in accessing the required results promptly. Thus, this paper proposed the similarity measurement method between words by deploying Jaccard Coefficient. Technically, we developed a measure of similarity Jaccard with Prolog programming language to compare similarity between sets of data. Furthermore, the performance of this proposed similarity measurement method was accomplished by employing precision, recall, and F-measure. Precisely, the test results demonstrated the awareness of advantage and disadvantages of the measurement which were adapted and applied to a search for meaning by using Jaccard similarity coefficient.},
